### Agent Workflow Setup

- Migrated from `.rules/` folder to `agents/` workflow structure
- Created CLAUDE.md entry point, agents/ files, docs/requirements and docs/design structure
- Retained all project knowledge from .rules into agents/memory.md and design-patterns.md
- Added brownfield workflow for deriving documentation from existing code

### Documentation Derivation

Derived requirements and design docs from existing codebase:

**Requirements (docs/requirements/):**
- `01-parser.md` — Parser package: schema extraction, validation, dual API, supported SQL features, known limitations
- `02-cli.md` — CLI: all 7 commands (init, inspect, apply, combine, import, export, dbml), global options, config format, validation rules
- `03-dbml.md` — DBML generation: SQL-to-DBML conversion, multi-document support, filtering

**Design (docs/design/):**
- `01-parser.md` — Three-layer pipeline architecture, module map, output shapes, error handling, fallback extraction
- `02-cli.md` — Design class orchestration, configuration pipeline, reference extraction, entity lifecycle, execution via psql, technical debt
- `03-configuration.md` — design.yaml full schema, project directory layout, entity type system, import flow, DBML config
